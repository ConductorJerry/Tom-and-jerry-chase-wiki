# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements modern image format optimization for the Tom and Jerry Chase wiki to significantly improve loading performance and reduce bandwidth usage. The optimization will add support for WebP and AVIF formats while maintaining PNG fallbacks for compatibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user visiting the wiki, I want images to load faster and consume less bandwidth, so that I can browse character information more efficiently on mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads any page with images THEN the browser SHALL serve WebP format if supported
2. WHEN a user's browser supports AVIF THEN the system SHALL serve AVIF format for maximum compression
3. WHEN a user's browser doesn't support modern formats THEN the system SHALL fallback to PNG format
4. WHEN images are served THEN they SHALL maintain visual quality equivalent to original PNG files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the image optimization to be automatic and transparent, so that no changes are needed to existing image references.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing image paths are used THEN Next.js SHALL automatically serve optimized formats
2. WHEN new images are added THEN they SHALL automatically benefit from format optimization
3. WHEN the system serves optimized images THEN proper caching headers SHALL be applied
4. WHEN images fail to load in modern formats THEN graceful fallback SHALL occur

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want to monitor the performance impact of image optimization, so that I can verify the improvements are working as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN image optimization is enabled THEN loading performance SHALL improve by 40-60%
2. WHEN bandwidth usage is measured THEN it SHALL be reduced by 60-80% for images
3. WHEN Core Web Vitals are measured THEN LCP SHALL show measurable improvement
4. WHEN caching is configured THEN images SHALL be cached for optimal performance
