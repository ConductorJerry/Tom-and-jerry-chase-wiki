# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements data chunking and lazy loading optimization for the Tom and Jerry Chase Wiki to improve application performance and user experience. Currently, all character data is loaded at once through static imports, which can impact initial load times and memory usage. This optimization will implement dynamic data loading strategies while maintaining backward compatibility and ensuring optimal user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user visiting the wiki, I want the application to load quickly with minimal initial bundle size, so that I can access information without waiting for unnecessary data to load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load only essential data required for the initial page view
2. WHEN a user navigates to a faction page THEN the system SHALL dynamically load only that faction's character data
3. WHEN character data is requested THEN the system SHALL serve it within 200ms from cache or 500ms from dynamic import
4. WHEN the initial bundle is analyzed THEN the character data SHALL be excluded from the main bundle, reducing size by at least 30%

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want the new data loading system to maintain API compatibility, so that existing components continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing components access character data THEN the system SHALL provide the same interface as the current implementation
2. WHEN the GameDataManager methods are called THEN the system SHALL return data in the same format as before
3. WHEN components use the characters proxy object THEN the system SHALL maintain reactivity and state management functionality
4. IF data is not yet loaded THEN the system SHALL provide loading states without breaking component rendering

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user browsing character information, I want seamless navigation between characters and factions, so that I don't experience loading delays or interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits a faction page THEN the system SHALL preload that faction's data before the page renders
2. WHEN a user hovers over faction navigation links THEN the system SHALL prefetch that faction's data
3. WHEN data is being loaded THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading states with skeleton screens
4. WHEN data loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide error states with retry functionality
5. WHEN data is successfully loaded THEN the system SHALL cache it for subsequent requests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with limited bandwidth or on a mobile device, I want to download only the data I need, so that I can conserve data usage and improve performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses only cat characters THEN the system SHALL NOT download mouse character data
2. WHEN a user accesses only mouse characters THEN the system SHALL NOT download cat character data
3. WHEN character data is cached THEN the system SHALL respect browser cache policies and provide offline access
4. WHEN the user's connection is slow THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical data loading over non-essential data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer implementing new features, I want a flexible data loading system with hooks and utilities, so that I can easily implement efficient data fetching patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new components THEN the system SHALL provide React hooks for data loading (useCharacterData, useFactionData)
2. WHEN components need specific character data THEN the system SHALL provide granular loading functions
3. WHEN implementing search functionality THEN the system SHALL support partial data loading for search results
4. WHEN debugging data loading THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and loading states
5. WHEN data needs to be invalidated THEN the system SHALL provide cache management utilities

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator monitoring performance, I want visibility into data loading patterns and performance metrics, so that I can optimize the system further.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is loaded dynamically THEN the system SHALL log loading times and cache hit rates
2. WHEN bundle analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL show clear separation between static and dynamic chunks
3. WHEN performance monitoring is enabled THEN the system SHALL track data loading performance metrics
4. WHEN errors occur during data loading THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
