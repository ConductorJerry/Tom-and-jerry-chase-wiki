  - Modify next.config.mjs to add formats array with AVIF and WebP support
  - Configure minimumCacheTTL for optimal caching performance
  - Set appropriate deviceSizes and imageSizes for responsive images
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 3.4_

- [x] 2. Enhance GameImage component with modern image loading features

- [x] 3. Update image loading strategy across character components
  - Modify CharacterGrid to use priority loading for first 4 images
  - Ensure proper sizes attribute for responsive loading
  - Test image loading behavior in different viewport sizes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1_

- [x] 4. Verify and test image optimization implementation
  - Test image format delivery in different browsers
  - Verify fallback behavior for unsupported formats
  - Measure performance improvements using existing performance monitoring
  - Ensure PWA caching works correctly with optimized images
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_
